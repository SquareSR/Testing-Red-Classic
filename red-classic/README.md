Carbos Strategies for this route:

| How to outspeed | Dugtrio/Jynx | Sabrina's Zam | Agatha's 1st Gengar |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Silph Carbos    |      ...     |       5       |        ...          |
| Safari Carbos   |       1      |      5-7      |       (11-12)       |
| Mansion Carbos  |      0-1     |      5-8      |     (11-12) + 13    |

If below 5 spd dv, you should strongly consider resetting early
- The standard strategy if you take below 5 speed is to X-Speed Sabrina's Mr. Mime.
- According to simulations by Grogir, the winrate is only about 55.6% and the avg win time is +5.6 or more time lossed.

If you choose to run with 4 speed there is a slow alternative to play safely:
- Safari Carbos, Mansion Carbos, and the extra hidden candy in mansion
- timeloss from this is about +27-30s

If you have 11-12 speed you may choose to get 2 carbos to skip x-speed on Agatha
- This loses ~10 seconds, but ups the winrate on Agatha

**The new strategy any time we use both safari and Mansion Carbos:**
- Use all candies right away at the start of EQ menu
- Delay using safari carbos until inside mansion

### Glossary

- Moves: HA = Horn Attack, BB = Bubblebeam, WG = Water Gun, TB = Thunderbolt, PS = Poison Sting, HD = Horn Drill, IB = Ice Beam, RS = Rock Slide
	- (+ MOVE): A situational move used to finish off a pokemon when a damage range is missed
- Livesplits has an autosplitter built in for pokemon red
  - Activate within “edit splits” and then go into settings to set your preferences for where you want to split
- Hard Resetting **during** a classic speedrun is not allowed
  - If you ever take a safety save into a death during the run, then you can only **soft reset** using **A + B + Start + Select** held at once
  - Hard Resetting the console means that RNG Manipulation is technically possible and this is banned from classic

### Before you start
- Clear any existing save file by pressing **Up + B + Select** on the game title screen
- Hard Reset (set palette with Up + B - optional to give full visibility in rock tunnel), **hard resetting is required before each attempt on emu**
- Set your options to fast text and animations OFF
