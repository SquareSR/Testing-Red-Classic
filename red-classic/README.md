### Glossary

- Moves: HA = Horn Attack, BB = Bubblebeam, WG = Water Gun, TB = Thunderbolt, PS = Poison Sting, HD = Horn Drill, IB = Ice Beam, RS = Rock Slide
	- (+ MOVE): A situational move used to finish off a pokemon when a damage range is missed
- Livesplits has an autosplitter built in for pokemon red
  - Activate within “edit splits” and then go into settings to set your preferences for where you want to split
- Hard Resetting **during** a classic speedrun is not allowed
  - If you ever take a safety save into a death during the run, then you can only **soft reset** using **A + B + Start + Select** held at once
  - Hard Resetting the console means that RNG Manipulation is technically possible and this is banned from classic

### Before you start
- Clear any existing save file by pressing **Up + B + Select** on the game title screen
- Hard Reset (set palette with Up + B - optional to give full visibility in rock tunnel), **hard resetting is required before each attempt on emu**
- Set your options to fast text and animations OFF

## NIDORAN SPLIT

Name yourself and rival “A” or any one character.

Pickup the PC Potion

Name Squirtle one character. 

> Naming squirtle “B” can help avoid confusion later when checking stats on Brock and teaching moves throughout the run, assuming you plan to name Nidoran “A”. 

Rival 1:
- Tail Whip + spam Tackle 

> Tail whip turn 2 if growled turn 1 
> - This is slower on average but has a higher win rate

Route 1
- Spam Tackle to faint one encounter that is L2 or L3

> This early EXP will get Bubble for Brock

Viridian Mart
- Buy 8 Poke Balls 

Walk West to the grass patch on Route 22

Optional - Save the game before searching for nidoran.

- Catch a L3 or L4 Nidoran-M and give it a one-character name.
	- Tackle L3 Nido once before throwing pokeballs.  
	- L4 Nido, just throw pokeballs.  
	- L5 Spearow, just throw pokeballs, since it outspeeds us
