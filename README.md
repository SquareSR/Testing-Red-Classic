### Glossary

- Moves: HA = Horn Attack, BB = Bubblebeam, WG = Water Gun, TB = Thunderbolt, PS = Poison Sting, HD = Horn Drill, IB = Ice Beam, RS = Rock Slide
	- (+ MOVE): A situational move used to finish off a pokemon when a damage range is missed
- Livesplits has an autosplitter built in for pokemon red
  - Activate within “edit splits” and then go into settings to set your preferences for where you want to split
- Hard Resetting **during** a classic speedrun is not allowed
  - If you ever take a safety save into a death during the run, then you can only **soft reset** using **A + B + Start + Select** held at once
  - Hard Resetting the console means that RNG Manipulation is technically possible and this is banned from classic

### Before you start
- Clear any existing save file by pressing **Up + B + Select** on the game title screen
- Hard Reset (set palette with Up + B - optional to give full visibility in rock tunnel), **hard resetting is required before each attempt on emu**
- Set your options to fast text and animations OFF

## NIDORAN SPLIT

Name yourself and rival “A” or any one character.

Pickup the PC Potion

Name Squirtle one character. Naming squirtle “B” can help avoid confusion later when checking stats on Brock and teaching moves throughout the run, assuming you plan to name Nidoran “A”. 

Rival 1:
- Tail Whip + spam Tackle (tail whip turn 2 if growled turn 1 - slower on average but higher win rate)

> Optional: check stats on level up after Rival 1
> - 11 SPC is likely bad special (3 hit on Geodude and/or Onix)
> - 12 SPC is guaranteed good special (2 hit on Geodude & Onix)

Route 1
- Spam Tackle to faint one encounter that is L2 or L3 (This early EXP will get Bubble for Brock)

Viridian Mart
- Buy 8 Poke Balls 

Walk West to the grass patch on Route 22

Catch a L3 or L4 Nidoran-M and give it a one-character name.
